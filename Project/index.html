                The global COVID-19 pandemic has cast a spotlight on the importance of public health.
                To understand the pandemic's impact, it's crucial to examine it in the context of existing health
                trends.
                This analysis will delve into three key data points: established causes of death, life expectancy by
                country,
                and deaths due to COVID-19 by year and month. By looking at how these factors interact, we can gain
                valuable
                insights into how the pandemic has influenced global health and identify areas where public health
                efforts
                might need to be adjusted. For instance, comparing established causes of death to COVID-19 mortality
                rates
                can reveal if the pandemic has become a leading cause of death. Similarly, analyzing how life expectancy
                has
                changed in different countries throughout the pandemic can shed light on its overall health impact.
                By bringing these data points together, we can build a more comprehensive picture of public health in
                the
                face of COVID-19.
